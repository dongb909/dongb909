### Hi, I'm Rachel ðŸ‘‹ :woman_technologist:

I'm a software engineer who is passionate about creating technology to elevate people and that brings good into far reaching communities. My main tech stack includes, Javascript, ReactJS, Express, PostgreSQL, and mongoDB. But, as I enjoy continuously learning and building upon my skills, I am also working on a project that involves React Hooks and Typescript at the moment. ðŸŒ±

âœ¨ A fun fact: My Vietnamese name is BacAi. My mom took it from the Bible (it means 'humanitarinism') even though our family is buddhist. ðŸ¤” :woman_shrugging:
