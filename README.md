### Hi, I'm Rachel ðŸ‘‹ :woman_technologist:

I'm a software engineer who is passionate about creating technology to elevate people and bring good into far reaching communities. My main tech stack includes, Node.js, Javascript, ReactJS, Express, PostgreSQL, and mongoDB. I work well both, autonomously or in a team. I'm also a continuous learner, I don't shy from questions and I love passing on the knowledge to others. 

ðŸŒ± Currently learning and building with: Typescripts, React Hooks 

âœ¨ A fun fact: My Vietnamese name is BacAi. My mom took it from the Bible (it means 'altruism') even though our family is buddhist. ðŸ¤” :woman_shrugging:
